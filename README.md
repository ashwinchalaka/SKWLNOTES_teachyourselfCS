# Welcome to SKWLNotes for Teach Yourself Computer Science

Found [this amazing resource](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) that has compiled all free online resources for Computer Science degree materials. I decided that I am going to follow their program to prepare for the remaining two years of my CS degree.

I plan to be taking written account of the experience which will include:

* Notes on lectures
* Notes on Reading
* Links to all online materials
* Exercises and program examples

The SKWLNotes content is organized as per the program outline on the teachyourselfCS website (^linked above).

I hope SKWLNotes can be helpful to you.
